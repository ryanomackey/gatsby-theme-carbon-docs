Gatsby theme for MDX-powered docs using the Carbon Design System

## Using the theme

### Getting started

1. Download the starter with theme

```bash
npx gatsby new my-carbon-docs https://github.com/ryanomackey/gatsby-carbon-docs-starter

cd my-carbon-docs
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
# With NPM:
npm install

# With Yarn:
yarn
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
# With NPM:
npm run develop

# With Yarn:
yarn develop
```

If all went well, you should be able to head over to `http://localhost:8000` to see your new docs!

If all _didn't_ go so well, or you're just curious about Gatsby itself, head over to [their documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) for more information.

### Adding content

#### Adding a new section

At the root of your project should be a directory called `data` with a file called `sections.yaml`.

This file lets the theme know what you want the top-level sections of your left nav to be.

For example, if we wanted to add a new section, we could do so by simply adding a new entry like so:

```yaml{7-9}:title=data/sections.yaml
-
  location: books
  title: Books
-
  location: movies
  title: Movies
-
  location: music
  title: Music
```

#### Adding a new page

To add a page, simply add a new mdx file to the `docs/` directory:

```bash
touch docs/music/the-beatles.mdx
```

Now, in `the-beatles.mdx` we just add one piece of metadata (our title) and any other markdown/jsx content we want:

```markdown:title=the-beatles.md
---
title: The Beatles
---

The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960...
```

Now, if you head over to `http://localhost:8000/music/the-beatles`, you should see your brand new page.
